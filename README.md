# Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm  

This project is a web-based application that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. It provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing the graph and the calculated shortest path.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Input graph nodes and edges.  
- Calculate the shortest path between any two nodes using Dijkstra's Algorithm.  
- Visualize the shortest path on the graph.  
- Responsive and intuitive user interface.  

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Logic & Algorithm:** JavaScript  
- **Visualization:** DOM Manipulation  

## ðŸ“˜ How It Works  
1. Users can create a graph by specifying nodes and edges interactively.  
2. The application processes the input and applies Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest path.  
3. The shortest path is highlighted on the graph for better visualization.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
This project demonstrates the practical application of **data structures** and **algorithms** in solving real-world problems.
